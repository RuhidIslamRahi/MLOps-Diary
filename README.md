# MLOps-Diary
ðŸ“˜ MLOps Learning Journey
Welcome to my MLOps learning journey! ðŸš€
This repository documents my hands-on exploration, notes, and projects as I dive into Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)â€”from experimentation to deployment and monitoring in production.

ðŸ§­ Why This Repo?
MLOps is the backbone of bringing machine learning models to real-world applications. This repo serves as:

- A structured learning path
- A collection of mini-projects
- A personal knowledge base
- A reference for others learning MLOps
